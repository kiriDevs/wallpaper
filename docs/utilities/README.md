## What are utilities?

Utilities are defined as a single `.js` file in `/scripts/util/`
Utilities are very similar to modules, with the difference being that they don't do anything by themselves.
They include code that might be used by multiple modules, but don't actually manage any widgets themselves.

Utilities place whatever they provide in the global `Util` object.
